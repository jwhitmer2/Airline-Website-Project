<h1>About</h1>
<p>
	The purpose of this website is to serve as an application for our employees working at the booking counter for our airline. With this application they can service customer needs such as booking them an available flight or changing a passenger's information. Also included is information on things such as the airplanes in our fleet or the locations that our company services in order to satisfy potential questions from the customer or look up things like plane capacity to determine how close a flight is to being booked.
</p>

<p>
	CS355 Airline is a small up and coming company based out of San Francisco International Airport that hopes to compete with the few giant airlines that are dominating the market place with our excellent customer service and cheap rates. We serve several domestic locations and some of the most popular foreign ones. Due to the fact that we heavily rely on our service, we expect that each employee interact with every customer with fantastic attitudes and helpfulness.
